Ideas / Core Components / Functionalitiies 

1.   Data Acquisition and Storage:

    - Data Sources:  
        Financial APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Quandl, Yahoo Finance)  
        CSV/Excel files  
        Databases (e.g., SQL, NoSQL)  
        Data Cleaning, Preprocessing and normalisation
        Handling missing value 
        Outlier detection and treatment
        Feature engineering (e.g., technical indicators, fundamental ratios)  
    - Data Storage:  
        Efficient data structures (e.g., Pandas DataFrames)  
        Databases for long-term storage   


2.   Portfolio Backtesting:

    - Portfolio Construction:
        Define portfolio weights (e.g., equal-weighted, value-weighted, risk parity)    
        Consider transaction costs and rebalancing frequency  
    - Performance Metrics: 
        Calculate key metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, CAGR)  
        Visualize performance using charts (e.g., time-series plots, risk-return scatter plots)  
    - Risk Analysis:
        Conduct stress tests and scenario analysis  
        Estimate Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)  


3.   Portfolio Optimization:

    - Objective Function:  
        Define the optimization goal (e.g., maximize Sharpe ratio, minimize volatility)  
        Consider constraints (e.g., budget, risk limits, asset class weights)  
    - Optimization Algorithms:  
        Use techniques like mean-variance optimization, efficient frontier, or more advanced methods (e.g., Black-Litterman model)  
    - Portfolio Generation:  
    Generate optimal portfolios based on the optimization results  

4.   Monte Carlo Simulations:

    - Random Simulations:  
        Simulate future asset returns using historical data or stochastic processes (e.g., Geometric Brownian Motion)  
        Generate multiple scenarios for portfolio performance  
    - Risk Analysis:  
        Estimate probabilities of different outcomes (e.g., worst-case scenarios, best-case scenarios)  
        Calculate confidence intervals for performance metrics  
      
    
5.   Future Projections:

    - Forecasting Models:  
        Use statistical models (e.g., ARIMA, GARCH) or machine learning techniques (e.g., time series forecasting)  
        Forecast future asset returns and volatilities  
    - Scenario Analysis:  
        Explore different future scenarios based on various assumptions
